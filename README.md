# Signing Script  
This script is designed to set up a signing build environment.

## Disclaimer  
- **This script only works with password-less keys** (DO NOT SET A PASSWORD).  
  *This limitation exists because the build process is done inline. Additional steps are required if using a password.*  
- Compatible with **LineageOS 19.1+**.
